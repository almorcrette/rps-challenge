# Rock, Paper, Scissors... Spokc, lizard Web Game

Alexis Morcrette's solution to the Makers Academy week 3 Weekend Challenge.

## Scenario

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( MAMA ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
s a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

### Bonus functionality

Using bonus rules of Spock and lizard.

## Project approach

----------------------------------------------

At the barest minimum, it should contain a description of what the code does, how to install it, how to use it and how to run its tests. In addition, READMEs often include other information such as:

- Configuration instructions
- A file manifest (list of files included)
- Copyright and licensing information
- Contact information for the distributor or programmer
- Known bugs
- Troubleshooting
- Credits and acknowledgments
- A changelog (usually for programmers)
- A news section (usually for users)
